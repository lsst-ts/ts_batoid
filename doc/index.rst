This module is a high-level module to use PhoSim. This can put the perturbations of camera temperature, mirror gravity, and mirror temperature corrections into PhoSim. This can also put the perturbation of telescope degree of freedom (DOF) into PhoSim. This can combine with WEP and OFC module to do the closed-loop simulation on PhoSim as a test framework.
